# Tic Toc Toe

## Description

This is a simple text-based game where players and game created on base of the OOP. It is example to forces the designer to use pythonic and real world application usage.

## File Tree

The game's file tree is structured as follows:

- `ioput.py` ignores the Keyboard Interruption and validates variable types
- `game_engine.py` class definition of the game
- `player.py` class definition of the player object
- `main.py` main flow of the game, to avoid nested structure if you have some good ideas please share with us.
